## Installation (Desktop Version)
**Prerequiries** : [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) / [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Open a CMD window, you will need a clone of Vencord's Repository, command : `git clone https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord`
- Navigate to the path where you cloned the repository and be sure to enter the 'Vencord' folder (Ex : "`cd C:\Documents\Vencord`") then type : `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Now inside the 'Vencord' Folder, navigate to "`cd .\src\`" and type : "`md userplugins`"
- Navigate to "`cd .\userplugins\`", and clone CleanCord within : `git clone https://github.com/TetraSsky/CleanCord/`
- Then build : `pnpm build`
- And lastly inject : `pnpm inject` (Select your Discord path (Stable / Canary))

You're now ready to use CleanCord (be sure to enable it in Vencord's plugin settings) !

## Installation (Web Version)
**⚠️ Be sure to have completed all of the steps above ⚠️**

*You can however exclude both last commands : `pnpm build` & `pnpm inject`, since they're not needed for the web version*

*PS : If you have previously installed the official Vencord extension, you might want to disable/uninstall it to avoid conflicts*

- You will need to build as a web browser extension with : `pnpm buildWeb`
- This will generate a new folder in the main Vencord folder, path : 'Vencord\dist'
- Head on your web browser and open "chrome://extensions" (This can vary depending on your browser)
- Enable "Developer Mode" (*if available/needed*)
- Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the "dist/chromium-unpacked" folder for chromium based browsers or "dist/firefox-unpacked" for Firefox

You're now ready to use CleanCord, on your browser (same, be sure to enable it in Vencord's plugin settings) !

## Usage

### Hiding Servers/Folders

2. Select "Hide Server" or "Hide Folder" from the context menu
3. The server/folder will immediately disappear from your view

### Managing Hidden Items
1. Go to Vencord Settings > Plugins > CleanCord (Or right-click --> "Manage CleanCord's settings")

3. Toggle the checkboxes to show/hide items
4. Use "Unhide All" to reset everything

### Streamer Mode Integration

## FAQ

**❓: Do hidden servers still show notifications?**
- No, hidden servers won't display unread messages, mention counts or play notifications sounds.
(Only when **Suppresion Mode** is set to <ins>Silent</ins> & (Preferably) **Auto Clear Mentions** is <ins>enabled</ins>)

**❓: Can I still access hidden servers?**
- Yes, you can still access them through Quick Switcher (Ctrl+K), joining one of your friends' activity, etc... or by unhiding them in settings.

**❓: Does this plugin breaks interaction with hidden servers?**
- No, people from any hidden server can still interact with you and vise versa. The "icons" Discord displays in the server listing are only hidden with Custom CSS injection.

**❓ : Will people know I'm using CleanCord?**
- No, this is purely a visual change on your client. Moreover, there is a setting to completely hide CleanCord's right-click options!
(Same goes whilst streaming, by enabling the option, CleanCord will silently hide your hidden elements the moment **Streamer Mode** is on)

**❓: Will my hidden elements stay hidden after restarting Discord?**
- Yes, your preferences are saved between sessions thanks to Vencord!
